# Stable diffusion with PremAI.io

This is my submission for [Prem Challenge x LangChain](https://github.com/premAI-io/challenge-with-langchain).

I'm using `Stable Diffusion 2.1` from [PremAI.io](https://premai.io) to generate images from text prompts.

## Setup

- Clone the project
- Run `npm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
  - to get `VITE_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` you need an imgur account and your client id that you can get from [here](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient)
- Run `npm run dev`
